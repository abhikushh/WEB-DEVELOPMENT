	<P>One of the most interesting stages in life that gives you an opportunity to explore is the ‘college phase.’ Life at college is the time when the teenage years end and we all dive deep into the ocean of new beginnings and possibilities. This golden period better equips you for all the challenges you’ll face in life and creates a strong foundation of knowledge.

		By Julie Lain, YOUniversityTV Student Contributing Writer – As a kid, many people get asked different variations of the same question: “What has been your best experience?” And even at that age, there are many joyful moments to consider-birthday parties, trips to the local amusement park, and bicycle-riding lessons. But often, it is not until your adult life that you go through many of your most valuable events. Some, for instance, may find their time in the military to be of utmost importance to them, while others sometimes find that their experience as a parent was the most rewarding one they have had. Personally though, I consider my time in college as my most valuable experience.

			The good
There are a lot of things Dubai has done right. My first vote goes to Tolerant nature of the city. Over the weekend I was at a rock festival that started sometime during the evening. In the middle of one of the performances, the Adhaan (Muslim call for prayer) went off. The performers looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders, and said they will return after 10 minutes, after a prayer break. Not that any of them left to pray. They paused in respect for the prayer-call. You'll find clubs on the same stretch of the road as mosques. Which road you want to take is totally up to you.

		When you’re away from your family, your friends become your most important support network. These are the people you turn to on campus when something goes wrong but also when something goes right. They are the folks who will listen to you — complaining or gushing in solidarity with you. Hopefully, your friends will also be the ones to point out instances where you’re acting like an idiot — and you will learn to listen to them because their insight probably supersedes your own, in some situations.

You will also realize what it means to become fiercely loyal and protective of your friends — people can mess with you, but they better watch out if they try to mess with those close to you.

		It could be a professor. It could be the hot German graduate student who is always grading exams at your favorite coffee shop. It could be your best friend’s ex-boyfriend. At some point during your college career, you will fall for someone you know full well is off-limits. You’ll realize that you’ve begun to develop feelings when you catch yourself going to class 20 minutes early so you can make conversation with your professor before he starts lecturing. Or when you find yourself hanging at a particular study spot or in a particular frat more than usual on the off chance that you run into your crush.

You will attempt to nip these feelings in the bud. And sometimes, you should. But other times? You should just let them continue to chug full speed ahead.
